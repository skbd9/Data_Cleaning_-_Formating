# Excel Data Cleaning and Analysis
Welcome to the Excel Data Cleaning and Analysis repository! In this project, I've utilized various Excel formulas and Power Query techniques to clean and analyze a dataset containing information about clients, contacts, departments, payments, revenue, profit, and profit margins.

<h3>Key Highlights:</h3>

<p><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Employed Excel formulas, including SPLIT, TRIM, and handled VALUE errors to clean and transform dirty data.</p>
<p><strong>Power Query Transformation: </strong>Utilized Power Query to perform advanced data cleaning and shaping operations for creating a pristine dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Table Creation:</strong> Constructed a clean and organized table from the processed data, making it ready for further analysis.</p>
